# AlgoDat

This is a simple, yet beautiful GUI to be used for general algorithm & datastructure test applications. It was created as part of an algorithm and datastructures course-project at the TH-N&uuml;rnberg.

Now, I'm sharing it, so the following students don't have to reinvent the wheel and use ugly console applications to demo their implementations. Also, it demonstrates what's possible with just a few lines of code.

Currently, the application supports integer dictionaries only and has two convenience functions (add random, clear all).

I will not update this anymore, although I'm open to pull request.
